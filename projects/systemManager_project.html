            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p class="into-class">In today's era of big data, organizations are dealing with a vast amount of data that
                is
                often distributed across multiple databases. The management of multiple databases can be a
                complex and time-consuming task. A multiple database management system (MDBMS) is a
                software tool that can handle multiple databases from a single interface, enabling users to
                manage data efficiently</p>
            <p class="into-class">This project aims to develop an MDBMS using Java GUI and MySQL Server. The system
                will provide a user-friendly interface that will enable users to perform various database
                operations such as creating, modifying, and deleting databases, tables, and records. The system
                will also provide advanced search and filter functionalities to extract data from multiple
                databases easily.</p>
            <p class="into-class">The project will use Java GUI to create a user-friendly interface for the system. The
                system's backend will use MySQL Server to handle various database types, such as relational
                databases. The system will ensure security by implementing various security features such as
                user authentication and authorization.</p>
            <p class="into-class">The proposed system will benefit organizations that manage multiple databases as it
                will
                provide a centralized system to manage them efficiently. The system will also be useful for
                software developers as they can connect to multiple databases from a single interface, reducing
                the time and effort required to manage multiple databases.
            </p>
            <p class="into-class">The project will follow best practices in software engineering to ensure the
                development
                of high-quality software. The project team will conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system's
                functionality, reliability, and security. The system will be designed to handle large datasets
                efficiently. The project will document the system's development and provide user manuals to
                enable users to use the system effectively.</p>
            <p class="into-class">In summary, the development of an MDBMS using Java GUI and MySQL Server will
                provide an efficient and user-friendly tool for managing multiple databases. This system will
                be beneficial for organizations dealing with big data, as well as software developers who need
                to manage multiple databases.</p>

            <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT </h3>
            <p>Organizations dealing with large amounts of data often have multiple databases, which can be challenging
                to manage. The lack of a centralized system can lead to data inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities,
                and time-consuming management processes. Current solutions are limited, costly, and require specialized
                skills to operate. A costeffective, user-friendly, and secure multiple database management system is
                needed to address these challenges. This project proposes the development of an MDBMS using Java GUI and
                MySQL Server to meet this need.</p>

            <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>This project involves engineering an interactive server-client application designed to manage multiple
                databases efficiently. The frontend is developed using Java Swing, providing an intuitive and
                user-friendly graphical interface for users to interact with the system. The backend is implemented
                using Core Java, ensuring robust processing, data handling, and business logic execution. Communication
                between the client and server is established through Java Socket Programming, enabling seamless
                real-time data exchange and synchronization across multiple clients. The system utilizes MySQL as the
                database management system, ensuring reliable storage, retrieval, and management of large datasets.
                Together, these technologies create a scalable, secure, and efficient multiple database management
